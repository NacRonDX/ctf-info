HowToLogin is a tool that tests web application login pages for login bypass. HTLogin tests for various login bypass payloads, common default credentials and rate limits on the login forms in the given url and presents it to the user.

> [!NOTE]
> You can try this tool with https://github.com/akinerkisa/renikApp login bypass page section.

## How HTLogin Extracts Successful Login Attempts

HTLogin uses several techniques to detect whether a login attempt is successful:

1. **HTTP Status Code**:
   - The script checks if the login attempt results in an HTTP `302` redirection (which often indicates a successful login). A redirection generally means the user has been authenticated and is being forwarded to another page, such as a dashboard.
   - It extracts the redirection URL from the `Location` header. If the redirect URL is different from the original login page, it is likely that the login was successful.

2. **Cookies**:
   - The script checks for the presence of session cookies, especially cookies that contain the word "session."
   - When a session cookie is set by the server, it typically indicates that the server has started a new session for an authenticated user.

3. **Page Content**:
   - The script inspects the page's content by looking for specific **success keywords** such as `['welcome', 'dashboard', 'profile', 'logged in', 'successful']`.
   - It also ensures that **failure keywords** like `['invalid', 'incorrect', 'failed', 'error', 'try again']` do **not appear** on the page. This keyword analysis helps to distinguish successful attempts from failed ones.

4. **Comparison with Original Page**:
   - The script compares the content length of the redirection page to the original login page. If the redirected page has a different content length than the login page, it indicates that the user was likely redirected to a different page, which signals a successful login.

By using a combination of these methods—redirect detection, session cookies, keyword analysis, and content comparison—HTLogin is able to accurately determine whether a login attempt was successful.

## Multi-Language Support in Page Content Check
When checking the page content, it is checked in English by default. However, you can edit this with parameters. You can also add different languages and keywords by editing the `languages.json` file. Currently English and Turkish are defined.
Languages.json format:
```
    "en": { # Language defination
        "success": ["welcome", "dashboard", "profile", "logged in", "successful"], # Success keywords defination
        "failure": ["invalid", "incorrect", "failed", "error", "try again"] # Failure keywords defination
    }
```
